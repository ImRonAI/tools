"""
User handoff tool for Strands Agent.

This module provides functionality to hand off control from the agent to the user,
allowing for human intervention in automated workflows. It's particularly useful for:

1. Getting user confirmation before proceeding with critical actions
2. Requesting additional information that the agent cannot determine
3. Allowing users to review and approve agent decisions
4. Creating interactive workflows where human input is required
5. Debugging and troubleshooting by pausing execution for user review

Usage with Strands Agent:
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import handoff_to_user

agent = Agent(tools=[handoff_to_user])

# Request user input and continue
response = agent.tool.handoff_to_user(
    message="I need your approval to proceed with deleting these files. Type 'yes' to confirm.",
    breakout_of_loop=False
)

# Stop execution and hand off to user
agent.tool.handoff_to_user(
    message="Task completed. Please review the results and take any necessary follow-up actions.",
    breakout_of_loop=True
)
```

The handoff tool can either pause for user input or completely stop the event loop,
depending on the breakout_of_loop parameter.

    Hand off control from the agent to the user for human intervention.

    This tool allows the agent to pause execution and request human input or approval.
    It can either wait for user input and continue, or completely stop the event loop
    to hand off control to the user.

    Args:
        message: The message to display to the user. Should include context about what
                 the agent was doing, what it needs from the user, and clear instructions
        breakout_of_loop: Whether to stop the event loop after displaying the message.
                          True: Stop the event loop completely (agent hands off control)
                          False: Wait for user input and continue with the response (default)
        tool_context: ToolContext object provided by the framework containing tool invocation details

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing status and content with handoff result

    Notes:
        - Always provide clear, actionable messages to users
        - Use breakout_of_loop=True for final handoffs or when agent work is complete
        - Use breakout_of_loop=False for mid-workflow user input
        - The handoff is graceful, allowing current operations to complete
